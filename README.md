<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

This project serves as a go-to resource for students using our service. It features a variety of engaging games designed to enhance their learning experience. These interactive tools aim to make education enjoyable and effective, providing students with an innovative way to acquire knowledge and skills. The project is built with the PERN stack (PostgreSQL, Express, React, Node.js) and utilizes Apollo with GraphQL.

It's currently not deployed until the prototype MVP is completed.
